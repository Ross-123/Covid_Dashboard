Tab-based Covid-19 pandemic dashboard using Gradio, sqlite3
## Introduction
This project, "The Pandemic Generation," utilizes daily reports and time series data provided by CSSE at Johns Hopkins University csse_covid_19_data covering the period from January 22, 2020, to March 9, 2023, to create a tab-based pandemic dashboard. We used pandas and sqlite3 to build the database, employed gradio for proof of concept, and developed the final product. You can access the product via hugging face link:
